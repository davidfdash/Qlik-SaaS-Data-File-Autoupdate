This script is designed to check the modified date/time of all files within a Windows file system. It will store the modified time, and then recheck every 30 seconds. If it finds a later time, it will initiate the file upload to overwrite a Qlik Cloud data file. This should work in a Windows file share and requires that the values in config.py be set for your Qlik SaaS environment.
